## Tabular Task - Who will leave a job, Kaggle dataset
Followed the Deep AutoViML tutorial video and example code and used a Kaggle dataset on staff attrition.

I'm very impressed with the ease of using this library, and with a few simple lines of code we can achieve comparable results to Kaggle notebooks.

## Image Task - Dandelion Classification, Kaggle dataset

This is a relatively small dataset. AutoViML keeps crashing the runtime, I've opened some github issues with the project.

## NLP Task - Fake News Classification, Kaggle dataset
https://www.kaggle.com/clmentbisaillon/fake-and-real-news-dataset

AutoViML keeps crashing the runtime on this task as well. I opened issues on github with the project. Using the entire text dataset, AutoViML requires over 70GB of ram just to create a model.
